Objective
----------
Build a regression model to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG) based on attributes like engine size, weight, and other car characteristics. The process involves data preprocessing, feature analysis, visualization, and model evaluation to ensure accurate predictions.

Data Source
------------
Dataset: Automobile Dataset (Kaggle)
Contains various automobile features with MPG as the target variable.

Technologies Used
------------------
Python
Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
Scikit-learn (regression model training & evaluation)

Steps Involved
---------------
Data Loading – Import dataset from CSV
Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, convert data types
Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualize trends and correlations
Feature Engineering – Select and preprocess relevant variables
Model Selection – Train regression models
Model Evaluation – Compare performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
Prediction – Use trained model to predict MPG

Results
--------
The regression model successfully predicts MPG with a reasonable accuracy, indicating its potential for use in real-world vehicle efficiency analysis.
